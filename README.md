# Password-Generator
This is a Javascript powered password generator.

It utilizes four arrays, one for upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

A function of generatePassword contains the prompts and empty arrays. The while loop will continually run the message "Password must be between 8 and 128 characters" if they choose a number lower than 8 or higher than 128.

Then a number of if statements are ran to confirm which characters the user would like to use.

Then the character arrays are stored in the empty password array and sent back through the password return at the bottom.
